    "# Overview\n",
    "This first part is about making the features of the calculator program that the user will interact with. This is done by defining clean and testable functions. You can think of these as the \"core functions\" of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Functions\n",
    "The functions below are going to give the calculator program some basic arithmetic. I will be explaining each function, first with its purpose and what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. add(a, b): This function is for Addition. It adds two numbers.\n",
    "2. subtract(a, b): This function is for subtraction. It subtracts two numbers.\n",
    "3. divide(a, b): This function is for division. It divides two numbers.\n",
    "4. remainder(a, b): This function gets the remainder of two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Input validation\n",
    "The divide and remainder functions have input validation to ensure that: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The calculator program does not have errors or bugs (like run-time)\n",
    "- The calculator program follows basic arithmetic and mathematics rules\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test cases\n",
    "I wanted to test the functions before continuing to build the rest of the program. This is important because it ensures that my functions work well, and it clears up any worry of debugging later from here.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "The calculator program will be using these core functions for arithmetic logic, and I tested each function towards the end to ensure that there are no bugs."

    "    - This defines the options that the user will interact with in the program.\n",
    "    - A new variable is declared called \"op\" and it's assigned to an input function that prompts the user for an input to select from the arithmetic functions already defined earlier but with symbols as showing.\n",
    "    - It has a loop (while) to enure that the program keeps running until a valid math operation is entered.\n",
    "    - If an invalid operation is entered, it returns a simple message asking the user to enter one of the ones given\n",
